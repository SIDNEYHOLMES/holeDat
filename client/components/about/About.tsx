      <p>
        The developers of Hole Dat - Jorge Carvajal, Sidney Holmes, Zoe Hall, Samuel Littell, and Zachary Marullo - are currently students at Operation Spark.
        Operation Spark is a program that teaches individuals from underrepresented communities the skills needed to become software developers.
        The app was developed as a way for us to apply the skills we learned in the program and to help address a common problem in their community.
        The students worked collaboratively to design, build, and test the app, and they are excited to share it with the world.
